### Expected behavior
Describe what you had expected the command to do.

### Actual behavior
If your issue is with a command not working, please run the command again with the `-vvv` option (`--debug` in 0.x) and copy everything from the command down to the next prompt and paste it here between a pair of \`\`\` marks.
**Be sure to find the lines that read `Authorization: Bearer ` followed by a long series of charactrers and delete it. This is your session data and posting it publicly will compromise your account.** This will be removed from the output in future versions of Terminus.

### Steps to reproduce the behavior
Along with the steps, please run `terminus self:info` (`terminus cli info` in 0.x) and paste its output here between a pair of ``` marks. If you are submitting an issue for 0.x, please include which OS and command-line client you are using.
