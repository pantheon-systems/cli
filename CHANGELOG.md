### Changed
- Moved to Symfony Console
- Updated command structure. Please see [https://pantheon.io/docs/terminus/commands/compare](https://pantheon.io/docs/terminus/commands/compare) for updates.

_Terminus version v1.0 and later introduces a new command line and argument structure that is incompatible with any custom scripts that use 0.x Terminus or older plugins that you may be using.
